# Your theme's name must begin with Plastic, e.g. Plastic Horses
name: Plastic

# Your theme must provide hex values for these named colours. They are used for
# the terminal and hence use terminal colour names. The colour you set does not
# necessarily need match the name, think of them as your available palette for
# your syntax colours (6 normal + 6 bright variations). Do not remove any, do
# not add any new ones.
